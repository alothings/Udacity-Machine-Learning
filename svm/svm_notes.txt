Support Vector Machine
======================

Parameters:
- Kernel: Linear, rbf, sigmoid
- C: Controls trade-off between smooth decision boundary and training points.
    It works as a penalty parameter.
    Large value of C = More training points correct.
- Gamma: Kernel coefficient. If auto, then 1/n_features is used isntead.

Non-linear Data
===============

Svm convers non-linear data using "kernel trick", to reach solution
Takes low dimensional space and maps to very high dimensional space

Not separable kernel turns into separable.
Kernels in SVM, several come out of the box.
- SVC is a type of kernel that comes out-of-the-box. It has several parameters.


for instance:
    from sklearn.svm import SVC
    clf = SVC(kernel="linear")

More Kernels:
- Linear
- Poly
- RBF: Default, gives good non-linear approximation
- Sigmoid

Overfitting
===========

High Variance?
