Udacity Machine Learning: ud120-projects
========================================

Using the starter project code for students taking Udacity ud120, this guide will
follow the class instructions, and develop all the assignments and projects in Python.
In addition, a notes.txt file will consists of notes from the Udacity class videos and
from additional more in-depth information found in different sources.

March 2016: Starting work 

Class Structure
