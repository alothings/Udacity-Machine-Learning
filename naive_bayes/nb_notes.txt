Bayes
=====
P(C) = 0.01

- Sensitivity: 90% test is positive if you have C (sensitive)

- Specitivity: 90% test is negative if you don't have C (specific)

Question: Test = Positive, Whats the Probability he/she have C

P(A|B) = P(B|A)P(A) / P(B)


Strengths
=========
- Easy to implement
- It supports big feature spaces (thousands)

- It can break (phrases that encompass multiple words can mess)
