Accuracy vs Training Set Size
=============================

MORE DATA > FINE TUNED ALGORITHM

Learned about Python pickle files. In this case it's a dictionary in which each value
is also a dictionary (dictionary of dictionaries).

Created functions to retrieve data quickly. Such as:

- number_of_datapoints
- number_of_features
- poi_with_nan_total_payments
- has_quantified_salary

Important things to remember:

Merging data from different sources can lead to bias when running
a machine learning algorihtm.
